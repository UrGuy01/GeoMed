Project Name:
GeoMed: Geospatial Disease Monitoring and Medicine Demand Forecasting System

Project Description:
GeoMed is a research-driven system designed to track symptom frequencies, predict diseases, and forecast medicine demand using geospatial data. Built on a Support Vector Classification (SVC) model, this system analyzes user-reported symptoms to predict diseases and generate medicine recommendations. By integrating real-time symptom data with geographical information, GeoMed offers valuable insights into the spatial spread of diseases, allowing healthcare providers and pharmacies to make informed decisions about resource allocation.

The system leverages the Google Maps API for dynamic, interactive visualizations, where users can view symptom trends, disease predictions, and medicine demands across different regions. With heatmaps, bar charts, and location-based analysis, GeoMed provides a comprehensive view of how diseases and medicine requirements evolve geographically over time.

Key Features:
Symptom Tracking: Collect real-time data on user-reported symptoms by region.

Disease Prediction: Use the SVC model to predict diseases based on reported symptoms.

Medicine Demand Forecasting: Track and forecast medicine demand based on disease predictions and trends.

Geospatial Visualization: Visualize symptom frequencies, predicted diseases, and medicine demand on heatmaps and bar charts.

Google Maps Integration: Use interactive maps to display symptom, disease, and medicine data by region, providing an intuitive way to analyze disease hotspots and medicine needs.

Research Angle:
The research focuses on geospatial disease monitoring and medicine demand forecasting, exploring how real-time symptom data can help predict the spread of diseases and forecast the medicines needed in specific areas. The project aims to highlight the role of geographical data in healthcare decision-making, with a focus on proactive resource management and disease prevention.

Potential Research Paper Focus:
Evaluating the accuracy of disease prediction using the SVC model based on symptom input.

The role of geospatial tracking in understanding disease outbreaks and predicting medicine demand.

The potential benefits of real-time monitoring in healthcare and pharmacy resource optimization.

The use of interactive maps and data visualization in communicating healthcare needs to local authorities and pharmacies.
