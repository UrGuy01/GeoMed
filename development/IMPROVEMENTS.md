# GeoMed Model Improvements

## Summary of Improvements

We've significantly enhanced the medicine recommendation system by addressing several key limitations of the original model. Here's what we did:

### 1. Incorporated Symptom Severity

**Before**: The original model used binary values (0 or 1) to indicate whether a symptom was present.
**After**: We now use weighted severity values (1-7) for each symptom, allowing the model to consider symptom intensity.

### 2. Implemented Ensemble Learning

**Before**: The original model used only a single SVC model.
**After**: We created an ensemble approach that combines SVC with Random Forest, providing more robust predictions.

### 3. Added Prediction Confidence Scores

**Before**: The model simply predicted a disease without indicating its confidence level.
**After**: We now provide confidence percentages for each prediction, allowing users to understand prediction reliability.

### 4. Multiple Disease Suggestions

**Before**: Only a single disease prediction was provided, even when symptoms were ambiguous.
**After**: We now display the top 3 most likely diseases with their confidence scores, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in medical diagnosis.

### 5. Comprehensive Validation

**Before**: The model was evaluated only with basic accuracy metrics on a test set.
**After**: We implemented cross-validation and more thorough testing with diverse symptom combinations.

## Results

Our improved model shows better performance on ambiguous symptom combinations:

1. **Original problematic case** (high_fever, shivering, joint_pain):
   - Now correctly shows lower confidence (12.38%) and multiple possibilities
   - No longer incorrectly predicts AIDS with high confidence

2. **Specific disease cases**:
   - Shows higher confidence for classic symptom combinations (e.g., 47.45% for Fungal infection)
   - Correctly identifies diseases like Malaria, Typhoid, Gastroenteritis, and GERD

3. **Overall improvements**:
   - More realistic confidence scores that reflect medical uncertainty
   - More diverse and appropriate top disease predictions
   - Better tolerance for symptom variations

## Technical Implementation

1. **Severity-weighted features**: We use the Symptom-severity.csv file to assign weights from 1-7 for each symptom
2. **Voting Classifier**: Combines predictions from SVC and RandomForest models
3. **Probabilistic output**: Returns prediction probabilities instead of just class labels
4. **Top-K predictions**: Returns top 3 most likely diagnoses ranked by confidence

## Next Steps

1. Implement a mechanism to collect user feedback on prediction accuracy
2. Consider adding temporal data to track symptom progression
3. Integrate geographical disease prevalence data to improve predictions
4. Develop dynamic symptom questionnaires that adapt based on initial symptoms
